[SS#1] URLs do not redirect correctly
Problem:
If a the user has supplied a URL without http:// at the front then this causes
browsers to take the link as being a relative link back into the site. As a
result this causes the application to receive an invalid parameter, the url.

Solution:
Any models which are providing a URL field now have a regex test to ensure that
http:// is present before returning the URL. If the URL does not have http:// at
the front then it is prepended.

Longer-Term:
A cleaner longer-term solution is to re-factor out the regex functions and place
them into a set of helpers which can be used throughout the application if needs
be.

[SS#2] Manage profile page does not render
Problem:
The manager profile page does not render as expected. This is due to the fact that
the application is attempting to generate the form from the user session object.
Unfortunately this is not properly stored as a user object.

Solution:
Instead of using the user session object, the form will use the unique internal
userid to select the appropriate data from the database. This means that the user can
manage their profile and should only be able to update their own profile. This page
will require a valid user to exist in the session. If not then they will be denied
access.
